# Repository account with two factor authentification

I was having trouble uploading to GitHub.

-- Problem:
The IDE does not upload anything, it stays in a loop asking for the address of the repository.

-- First solution:
Delete the TFA.

-- Another solution:
check: https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=271507
